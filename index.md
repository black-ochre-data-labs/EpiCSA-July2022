# Precision Medicine for all

- Gap between healthcare for Aboriginal and non-aboriginal Australians
- Some treatments are ineffective for diverse communities

# The human reference genome does not reflect human diversity


_"Our analysis revealed ~296Mb in ~125k distinct contigs present in the populations of African descent, 
demonstrating that the African pan-genome contains **~10% more DNA than the current human reference genome.**"_
