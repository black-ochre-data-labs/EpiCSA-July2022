# Black Ochre Data Labs

![width:15cm bg left](./figures/group1.jpg)

- Public Health & Bioinformatics group
- Based in Adelaide & Perth
- Focused on: 
    - Developing Precision Health approaches for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders
    - Complex diseases that impact Indigenous Australians, including Type 2 Diabetes, Cardiovascular Disease, Chronic/Diabetic Kidney Disease


---

# The healthcare gap in Australia

- The growing inequality of healthcare for Aboriginal Australians
    - Infant mortality is **twice the rate of non-Indigenous Australians**.
    - Life expectancy at birth was 71.6 years for Indigenous males **(8.6 years less than non-Indigenous males)** and 75.6 years for Indigenous females **(7.8 years less than non-Indigenous females)**.

# Transgenerational Trauma

![w:22cm center](./figures/pos-slide-etcher.png)


---

# Epigenetics & Intergenerational Disease Risk

- Can we disentangle transgenerational components and link them to disease risk?
- What role does intergenerational trauma have on the epigenetic clock?
- Can we develop Precision Healthcare programs that:
    - integrate unique genomic/epigenomic profiles of Indigenous people
    - help people reconnect with their land

---

# Precision Health Applications for Indigenous Communities

- Precision Medicine holds promise to improve treatments for Indigenous Australians
    - Polygenic risk scores, personalised treatments, precise diagnostics etc
- Some treatments are ineffective for diverse communities
    - Misinterpretation of variants, treatment efficiveness
    - e.g. Chemotherapy drug `5-fluorouracil` on African Americans

- **Why?**

# <!--fit--> The human reference genome does not reflect human diversity
### _i.e. we're missing a lot_

_"Our analysis revealed ~296Mb in ~125k distinct contigs present in the populations of African descent, 
demonstrating that the African pan-genome contains **~10% more DNA than the current human reference genome.**"_

<!-- footer: Sherman et al. (2019). _Nature Genetics_ -->


---


# What we know that we don't know about the Aboriginal Australian genome


_Approximately 25% of all DNA variants in the genome of an Aboriginal person, disregarding variants inherited from non- Aboriginal ancestors, are unknown in people from outside of Australia._
...
_Of these Aboriginal-specific variants, 40% are likely to be found in a single region or community._ 
...
_Overall, ... genomic differences among Aboriginal communities across Australia are as great as those between populations across Europe and Asia combined. Thus, for example, **using information about people from the Northern Territory as a basis for treating people in South Western Australia would be equivalent to treating people with British ancestry on the basis of information about people from Cambodia**._

# Implications for Functional Genomics


- Annotation of genetic work is done with available _European-ancestry biased_ reference data:
    - Epigenomics Roadmap, ENCODE, FANTOM5, Blueprint etc
- DNA methylation is strongly influenced by underlying genetic variation 
(Hawe et al. 2022 and many others)

# What are Black Ochre Data Labs doing about it?

1. Developing a national framework for Indigenous Genomics
    - Collaborating with partners across Australia
    - Led by Alex Brown and Louise Lyons
2. Establishing reference genome resources to quanitfy genomic diversity of Indigenous Australians
    - Collaborating with the National Centre for Indigenous Genomics, ANU
    - Led by Bastien Llamas
3. Investigating the multi-omics structure of Indigenous South Australians within the PROPHECY cohort and develop Epigenetic biomarkers for disease prevention

# Precision Medicine

- Using PROPHECY multiomics datasets to develop biomarkers for T2D, Chronic Kidney Disease, CVD and 'Cancer of Unknown Primary'
    - Multiple MRFF grants
    - Using Machine Learning, clinical and socio-economic information and leveraging non-Indigenous datasets for validation
- Particular focus on DNA methylation
- Investigate the impact of unique genotypes on DNA methylation and gene expression variation

# International efforts

- T2D and transgenerational trauma are common across most Indigenous communities around the world
    - $14.9M New Frontiers Grant working with Mi'kmaw communities in Newfoundland
