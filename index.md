# Precision Medicine for all


- Some treatments are ineffective for diverse communities

# <!--fit--> The human reference genome does not reflect human diversity
### _i.e. we're missing a lot_

_"Our analysis revealed ~296Mb in ~125k distinct contigs present in the populations of African descent, 
demonstrating that the African pan-genome contains **~10% more DNA than the current human reference genome.**"_

# What we know that we don't know about the Aboriginal Australian genome

Easteal _et al_ 2020 _The American Journal of Human Genetics_

_Approximately 25% of all DNA variants in the genome of an Aboriginal person, disregarding variants inherited from non- Aboriginal ancestors, are unknown in people from outside of Australia._
...
_Of these Aboriginal-specific variants, 40% are likely to be found in a single region or community._ 
...
_Overall, ... genomic differences among Aboriginal communities across Australia are as great as those between populations across Europe and Asia combined. Thus, for example, **using information about people from the Northern Territory as a basis for treating people in South Western Australia would be equivalent to treating people with British ancestry on the basis of information about people from Cambodia**._
